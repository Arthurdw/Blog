# Welcome to my blog!

Welcome to my blog, I'm Arthur De Witte, and I'm a student at HOWEST (University College West Flanders) in Brugges,
Belgium. I'm currently studying for a bachelor in Computer Science, and I'm in my 2'nd year. I love learning and
experimenting with new technologies.

## What can you expect here?

I will be posting about my projects, my studies and other things I find interesting. As of writing this I'm mainly
interested in the [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) programming language. I'm also proficient
in [Python](https://www.python.org), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [Java](https://www.java.com/).

Besides from language specific posts, I'm greatly interested in building performant future-proof architectures.

## Is this blog open source?

Yes it is, it has been build with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), and uses
the [Terminal Theme from Panr](https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-terminal). The source code can be found
on [GitHub](https://github.com/Arthurdw/Blog).
